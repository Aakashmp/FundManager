## Project Structure

This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which promotes a clear separation of concerns and enhances code maintainability. The structure is organized as follows:

- **Models**: Contains data classes that represent the core data structures of the application.
- **Views**: Includes UI components and widgets that define the layout and presentation.
- **ViewModels**: Holds the business logic and acts as a bridge between the Models and Views, managing the state and providing data to the Views.

## State Management Choice

For state management, I have chosen the Provider package over alternatives like Bloc and Riverpod.

### Why Provider over Bloc or Riverpod

- **Simplicity**: Provider offers a straightforward and intuitive approach to state management, making it easier to implement and maintain.
- **Community Support**: As a widely adopted solution in the Flutter community, Provider has extensive documentation and community resources.
- **Flexibility**: Provider integrates seamlessly with the MVVM architecture, allowing for a clean separation of concerns without imposing a rigid structure.
- **Performance**: Provider is lightweight and efficient, ensuring that the application's performance remains optimal.

While Bloc and Riverpod are powerful tools, they can introduce additional complexity that may not be necessary for this project's requirements. Provider strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality, making it a suitable choice for our state management needs.

## Database Choice

I have opted to use Hive as our database solution over alternatives like SQLite and SharedPreferences.

- **Performance**: Hive is a fast and lightweight key-value database, optimized for Flutter applications.
- **Simplicity**: With a straightforward API, Hive allows for easy implementation and management of data storage.
- **No Native Dependencies**: Unlike SQLite, Hive does not rely on native code, reducing potential issues across different platforms.
- **Type Safety**: Hive supports strong typing, enabling compile-time checks and reducing runtime errors.
